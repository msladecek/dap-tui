TODO get rid of the event.content.content crap
TODO automatic cell unhooking
  1. register all the dependencies of a cell
  2. register all child cells (cells defined within the expr of the parent cell)
  3. when the value changes unhook all child cells from their dependencies
TODO put the keybindings documentation and their implementation nearer together
TODO commands
  add breakpoint (line number as input)
  evaluate (code as input)
  watch expression (expression as input)
TODO fix writing glitches
  border chars don't get cleared out
  content doesn't get correctly redrawn out on resize (cells are located in the wrong place)
TODO support multiple threads
TODO command input window
  input breakpoint line number

TODO control the order of cell callback execution (for aesthetics - printing top to bottom)

  order callbacks first by component then by id when executing them
TODO indicate in each window whenever scrolling is possible

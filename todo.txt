MAYBE distribute with homebrew?
TODO unify terminology `active`, `selected`, `focused`
TODO fix rounding issue in splits
TODO get rid of the event.content.content crap
TODO automatic cell unhooking
  1. register all the dependencies of a cell
  2. register all child cells (cells defined within the expr of the parent cell)
  3. when the value changes unhook all child cells from their dependencies
TODO put the keybindings documentation and their implementation nearer together
TODO commands
  add breakpoint (line number as input)
  evaluate (code as input)
  watch expression (expression as input)
TODO fix writing glitches
  border chars don't get cleared out
  cells count writes into debug screen on first load
  borders don't draw correctly on last row and last column of the window
  content doesn't get correctly redrawn out on resize (cells are located in the wrong place)
TODO support multiple threads
TODO command input window
  input breakpoint line number
  only shows up when input is needed
TODO control the order of cell callback execution (for aesthetics - printing top to bottom)
  create a macro (with-cell-context [<component> <id> ...]) and include context in callback set
  order callbacks first by component then by id when executing them
[done] granular text comparison to minimize output writes
  search from the left to find the first character that is different
  search from the right to find the last character that is different
  overwrite only the section between those two locations
TODO indicate in each window whenever scrolling is possible

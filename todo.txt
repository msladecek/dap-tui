[done] UI version 1
  left pane - list of events coming from dap server
  right pane - view of each event
  bottom - list of keybindings
  controls
  - up/down/j/k - switch to next event
  - s/n/i/c - send event step into, next, initialize, continue?
UI version 2
  C-h, C-l to switch between panes
  keybindings only effective in the active pane
  keybindings in popup window when ? is pressed
TODO a better (reactive?) way to manage the UI updates
TODO helper context managers for terminal sequence building (fennel macros?)
  (with-text-attrs {...}
    ; push stack at the start
    ...
    ) ; pop stack at the end
  (with-output-buffer
    ; create a buffer, push sequences into the buffer
    ...
    ) ; flush the buffer at the end
MAYBE distribute with homebrew?
[done] basic events view
  list of events + event details: display event as json formatted with jq
TODO basic debug view
  source code, stack trace, variables
TODO report bug in debugpy (connect argument being required in attach call)
TODO unify terminology `active`, `selected`, `focused`
TODO content scrolling; horizontal and vertical
MAYBE line-based react-like diffing
  1. draw content line by line into a table
  2. on every command compare the old table to the new table
  3. generate terminal sequences only for the differences
TODO fix rounding issue in splits
TODO setup defaults for scroll offsets instead of copying them around in each component
TODO get rid of the event.content.content crap
